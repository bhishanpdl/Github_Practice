this is a trial of using git hub using gitplus in atom editor.
It we edited the file we will see the color change to brown in the git repo
in the left hand side pane.
Type cmd shift a to add file.
We will see green notificaiton from git plus that the file has been added.
To commit cmd sht c.
In the bottom right we also see number of lines added and deleted.
Then type on the commit section and save it.
Then, to push I don't have shortcut.
Go to pallette (cmd shift p  or F6 i have changed to F6)
type git push, then hit enter.
I have already set password and username in simplici so it will easily push it.
We will see green buttom showing pushing.
Now go to remote browser and refresh the file, you will see the changes.
Edited again.
cmd shift a is add.
cmd shift c is commit.
cmd shift p for push.
cmd shift d is duplicate lines.
